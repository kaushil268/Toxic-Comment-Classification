# Toxic-Comment-Classification
 
 Large number of Wikipedia comments which have been labeled by human raters for toxic behavior are used. The types of toxicity are:

toxic
severe_toxic
obscene
threat
insult
identity_hate

Discussing things you care about can be difficult. The threat of abuse and harassment online means that many people stop expressing themselves and give up on seeking different opinions. Platforms struggle to effectively facilitate conversations, leading many communities to limit or completely shut down user comments.

I have build a multi-headed model that’s capable of detecting different types of of toxicity like threats, obscenity, insults, and identity-based hate better than Perspective’s current models. Dataset of comments from Wikipedia’s talk page edits has been used.

I have created a model which predicts a probability of each type of toxicity for each comment.
